## FoodTranslate

**FoodTranslate** is an Android app that assists users in determining the safety of consuming various foods, especially for sugar patients. Users can speak the name of a food item in their native language, and the app will translate it into English, consult ChatGPT for dietary advice, and read the response aloud. Future updates will extend support to other dietary restrictions and medical conditions, ensuring a comprehensive dietary guidance tool.
